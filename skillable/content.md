## üí• About Today‚Äôs Session

* We will be exploring the various ways to master inclusive data visuals with WCAG principles, allowing you to learn to design universally accessible dashboards, and ensure your analytics are user-friendly and inclusive for all abilities.
* Each exercise is made up of individual steps. The steps are written to provide a bit of a challenge, but we‚Äôve provided detailed answers under each step.
* Click on the ‚ÄòShow Answers‚Äô link under a step to see a gif walkthrough of how to complete the step.



## ‚≠êÔ∏è About Designing for Accessibility 

### Why make accessible dashboards? 

Focusing on accessibility when using Tableau not only expands the reach and impact of your work but also aligns with legal, ethical, and social best practices. It can enhance the quality and clarity of your visualizations, benefiting all users and promoting a more inclusive approach to data analysis and presentation. Making your Tableau content accessible and compliant with best practices is important for several reasons, 

**Broader Audience Reach & Ethical Responsibility:** 

* Ensuring your content is accessible means that it can be used and understood by a wider audience, including those with disabilities. Maximize the reach and impact of your work, allowing more people to benefit from the insights you provide. 
* Making your data visualizations accessible demonstrates a commitment to equity and inclusivity, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities, has equal access to information and opportunities for insight.

**Improved Usability for All Users:** 

* The principles of accessibility often lead to better overall usability. Designing for accessibility can result in clearer and more comprehensible visualizations, benefiting all users, not just those with disabilities. 

**Data Literacy and Engagement:** 

* Accessible content can help build data literacy across a broader segment of the population by ensuring that more people can interact with and understand data visualizations. This can lead to greater engagement with your content and more meaningful insights for a wider audience.

**Legal Compliance:** 

* Many regions and sectors have legal requirements for digital accessibility (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act in the United States, the European Accessibility Act in the EU). Ensuring your Tableau visualizations comply with these standards can help your organization avoid legal issues and fines.

# üìà Your Mission

## Mission Overview: 

You‚Äôre a freelance analyst that has recently been hired by the San Diego Zoo to help them find insights and understand trends in their attendance, attraction, and revenue data. The views must also follow accessibility best practices to allow all users to see and understand the data. 

The workbook below is from a prior analyst. It‚Äôs connected to the correct data source but it does not follow accessibility best practices. You have been tasked with making the views in this workbook accessible along with creating some new views.
